# React Snippet Library
### A collection of reusable React code snippets designed to simplify development and enhance productivity. 
**This library provides easy access to common patterns and examples used in React applications.**

## What It Is
### This repository serves as a central hub for React developers to:

- Store Reusable Code: Save snippets for components, hooks, utilities, and more.
- Accelerate Development: Quickly reference common solutions for React projects.
- Share Knowledge: Collaborate and contribute your favorite snippets to the library.

## So Code uses the following imports: 
 - react-router-dom
 - AuthProvider 
 - PrivateRoute 

# Instructions on how to integrate into your VS Code project

2. Choose `javascript.json` or another file where you want to add or edit your snippets.
3. Copy and paste the repo snippet boilerplate code into the snippet file - be sure to check that all code is correctly pasted in.
4. Edit, change, or update any part of the snippet you like such as the `prefix`, `body`, or `name`.
5. Give it a test run - if all works out you are good to go! Happy Coding! ☺️
